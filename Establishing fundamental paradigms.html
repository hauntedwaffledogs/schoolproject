          <p class="E">the 1960s and 1970 brought major advancements in coding.
             The programming language named “Speakeasy” was invented by the Argonne National Laboratory in 1964 by Stanly Cohen.
            Simula was invented in the late 1960s and was the first object-oriented programming. The language of C was an early systems programming language that was invented between 1969 and 1973 by Dennis Richie, Ken Thompson, and Bell Labs.
            Smalltalk was invented in the mid-1970s witch provided a ground-up design of an object-oriented language.
            Prolog was designed in 1972 and was the first logic programming language, it was designed by Alian Colomeraure, and Robert Kowalski. ML was built as a polymorphic type base system developed by Robin Miner in 1973 and was pioneered the statically typed functional programing language.</p>
